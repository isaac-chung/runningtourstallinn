## Logistics :truck:
- **Start time**: This is highly tailored to your needs. Let us know in the booking what time you'd like to start so we can plan accordingly (subject to availability)
- **Start / Finish location**: Most routes start and finish by Viru Gates. Let us know in the booking if you'd prefer to start/finish elsewhere (e.g. by your hotel, by a bar 🍺 ).
- **Pace**: By default we will aim for 6min/km (10min/mile) pace to start with. During the run, we will check in with you often as well. 
- **What does this include?**: All runs include photo stops where you can take photos and fueling stops for anything you've brought along.

## Bookings and Cancellations
- Bookings: You are welcome to book at least **24 hours in advance** (subject to availability)
- Cancellations: Please allow at least 24-hour notice for any cancellations no matter the reason. This means that we can attend to other runners during your slot.


## Important Notes❗
1. 💰 While we have a non-tipping policy, feel free to donate to support our back office activities!
2. 🏃‍♂️ We are local runners and _not_ official tour guides, but we'll do our best to drop some fun facts along the way. 
3. ❄️ Dress for the weather. Estonia can be very cold, windy, and icy during the winter and warm in the summer. So be sure to dress appropriately.
4. 🎉 Above all, have fun!
