## Logistics
- **Start time**: This is highly tailored to your needs. Let us know in the booking when you wish to start (in 24-hour clock, e.g. 19:00 will be 7pm) so we can plan accordingly (suject to availability)
- **Start / Finish location**: Most routes start and finish by the Viru Gates. Let us know in the booking if you wish to start/finish from a different location (e.g. by your hotel, by a bar 🍺 ).
- **Pace**: This will vary depending on your comfort level. Let us know if you have a pace in mind. During the run, we will check in with you often as well. By default we will aim for 6min/km (10min/mile) pace to start with.
- **Total time**: This will vary depending on pace and how many stops we take. We will make time for photo stops and fuel stops.
