# Frequently Asked Questions
See if any of the questions below matches yours. Let me know if you still have questions!

## How can I join the free running tour?
To guarantee a spot on a free tour, please book via whatsapp or email. Someone from our team will reach out to follow up and confirm the times. Thank you!

## Where can I send a complaint or suggestion?
If you have any complaints and suggestions, please let our team member know directly or contact us via whatsapp or email. 

## Do you have tours every day?
It depends on demand and availability of the team. As no one on the team is full time, it is best to contact us to inquire about any specific times you have in mind.

## What can I do if I’m late?
Message the team member who is leading the run to let them know so that they can try to make arrangements with you.

## How do I find the meeting point?
Every route's start point has a Google Maps link on the website. 

## How do I recognise the team member who is leading the run?
They should be in running gear. Let each other know a piece of clothing that is recognizable, e.g. a pink cap, or a blue jacket.

## How much I should tip my guide?
For a pay-as-you-wish tour, tipping is completely voluntary. A flat white or cappuccino at a cafe will be ~€5. A regular lunch is ~€10, beer ~€6.5. If you want to take your loved one for a nice dinner, be ready for at least €30 per person. Movies would be ~€12 per person. We hope this will help!

## How fast will we run?
It will depend on the pace you're comfortable with. Let the team member know what a conversational pace would be for you.

## I need to cancel my booking. What should I do?
Please allow at least 24 hours notice for any cancellation. Life happens. Let your team member know as soon as possible.

## Will anyone else join us?
If the route is popular that day, it is possible that you will run with other runners. 

## Is there a toilet / refreshment break during the tour?
Many tours will have a break, especially when it is very cold or very hot. Not all of the tours have them, though. You can always ask your team member when the need arises.

## I liked my tour. What can I do next?
Write a review on socials (e.g. [Google](https://g.co/kgs/imqSxmJ), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61555150562314)) and let our team member know!

## Do you offer private tours?
Yes we do! Please contact our team to book it.

## I love trail running. What is this 15km pure trail option?
This involves additional costs like transit to the trails from the city center, as well as use of a locker and sauna (highly recommended) if desired. In terms of timing, with taxi, 15km running, and sauna, it would take ~3 hours total.
