# Hit the Trails

This route brings us to the forest trails around Tallinn. We will go through the lesser-visited parts and residential neighbourhoods on the south side of the city. 

The 11km options starts and finishes at [Freedom Square](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mWmMoZELgbBYJfxE6).

There is also an option to do 15km of pure forest trail. This will require some travelling from the city center (~20min by taxi/car hailing, one way).
